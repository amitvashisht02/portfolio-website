            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Amit — a self-taught, aspiring software developer who loves turning ideas into clean and functional interfaces.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                I started learning web development on my own, and every day I’m building, breaking, and improving things to grow faster. I enjoy understanding concepts deeply and creating simple solutions that work smoothly.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Right now, I’m learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and I’m constantly practising by building small projects and exploring UI/UX along the way.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                I’m currently searching for a frontend internship or junior developer role where I can learn from real-world challenges and contribute to meaningful work.</p>
